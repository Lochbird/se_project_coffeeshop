## Plan on improving the project

One idea I had was to have each page blend into each other much like walking into another room in the same house rather than a gradient or a hard edge. Specifically, I mean that the transition to one section to the next has an artistic approach, a border with a dragon or an unconventional bi-sector that divides the page at an angle. This idea could certainly uses experimentation, for all I know there is a reason why we aren't so lean on the idea.

A lot of videos don't meet my needs often, so rather than two videos, I would love to learn how to rotate the video playlist in a way so that it remains simplistic but you can have options beyond the presented.
