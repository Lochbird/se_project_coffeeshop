# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One idea I have that could improve the project is instead of each page abruptly stopping each new section, it instead blends in comparable to you walking through another door to a new room rather than a gradient kind of blend.
Knowing me, I may need a few more videos than one to find just the one I want. A feature I would love to learn is a way to switch videos in its place, while still keeping to the same subject. Versatility, I believe anyway, allows for more flow to go through the website instead of keeping it to the general few.
